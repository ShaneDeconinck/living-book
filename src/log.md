# Session Log

## 2026-03-12: Foundation Chapters

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 1: "Why Agents Break Trust" — the problem statement. Covers why traditional IAM breaks down, the confused deputy problem with agents, shadow agents, the reliability vs. governance split, and what trust infrastructure looks like.
- Wrote Chapter 2: "The PAC Framework" — deep walkthrough of all three pillars (Potential, Accountability, Control) with their dimensions, scales, and interdependencies.
- Expanded the Introduction with book purpose, audience, and structure.
- Populated Gaps & Directions with observations and a prioritized list of next chapters.

**Why these first:**
The book was empty. It needed a foundation: a clear problem statement and a thorough explanation of the framework that organizes everything else. These two chapters set up every subsequent chapter.

**Sources used:**
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai (read fresh)
- All of Shane's blog posts (read and analyzed for voice, themes, and claims)
- NIST concept paper on AI agent identity and authorization (February 2026)
- EU AI Act enforcement timeline (August 2026 high-risk obligations)
- Web search on OAuth extensions for agentic AI, agent gateways, DPoP, Zero Trust for agents

**What I noticed:**
- NIST and EU AI Act enforcement are converging on agent governance simultaneously. This timing is significant for the regulatory chapter.
- Agent gateways are an emerging infrastructure pattern that Shane hasn't covered directly but maps well to the Control pillar.
- The complacency problem (better reliability leading to worse oversight) connects to decades of human factors research in aviation. Worth grounding in that literature.
- Shane's framing of "delegation becomes abdication" is the single most important insight for the accountability argument. Built Chapter 1 around it.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Agent Identity and Delegation chapter (strongest source material, high impact)
2. Context Infrastructure chapter (most original contribution from Shane)

## 2026-03-12: Agent Identity and Delegation Chapter

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 3: "Agent Identity and Delegation" covering the full technical landscape of agent identity infrastructure. Sections: trust inversion, why traditional IAM breaks down (history from LDAP through DIDs), OAuth extensions for agents (OBO, DPoP, Auth0 Token Vault), decentralized identity (DIDs, VCs, TSP), Verifiable Intent (Mastercard/Google three-layer SD-JWT), regulatory convergence (NIST, OpenID, eIDAS 2.0), mapping back to PAC infrastructure levels, and practical recommendations.
- Updated Gaps & Directions with new observations on Verifiable Intent and standards convergence.
- Marked Agent Identity as done in the chapter priority list.

**Why this chapter:**
It was the #1 priority in the gaps doc, Shane has the strongest source material across 6+ blog posts, and the standards landscape is moving fast (NIST comment period closes April 2, 2026). Timely and foundational.

**Sources used:**
- Shane's blog posts: trust inversion, IAM breakdown, auth crash course, Google Workspace/OAuth critique, verifiable credentials signing, Verifiable Intent analysis, IAM emerging patterns
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai
- IETF: RFC 8693 (Token Exchange), RFC 9449 (DPoP), draft-oauth-ai-agents-on-behalf-of-user-02
- NIST: "Accelerating the Adoption of Software and AI Agent Identity and Authorization" (Feb 2026)
- OpenID Foundation: AIIM Community Group whitepaper
- Mastercard/Google: Verifiable Intent specification (March 2026)
- Auth0: Token Vault for AI Agents documentation
- Web searches on TSP, eIDAS 2.0, agent identity standards 2026

**What I noticed:**
- Verifiable Intent is the first production-grade answer to Shane's consent theater critique. The three-layer SD-JWT architecture maps cleanly to PAC: Layer 1 is identity (Control), Layer 2 is intent constraints (Accountability), Layer 3 is action proof (all three pillars).
- The identity standards landscape is converging faster than expected. NIST, OpenID, IETF, and industry (Mastercard/Google/Stripe) are all moving simultaneously. The PAC Framework's emphasis on building on standards rather than proprietary solutions is well-timed.
- Auth0 Token Vault is pragmatic but limited: it solves credential management but not purpose encoding or delegation tracking. Good for I2-I3 infrastructure levels.
- The infrastructure maturity table (I1-I5 mapped to identity capabilities) is a useful framing that could extend to other chapters.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Context Infrastructure chapter (Shane's most original contribution, high impact)
2. Regulatory Landscape chapter (timely given August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement)
