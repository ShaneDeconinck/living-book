# Session Log

## 2026-03-12: Foundation Chapters

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 1: "Why Agents Break Trust" — the problem statement. Covers why traditional IAM breaks down, the confused deputy problem with agents, shadow agents, the reliability vs. governance split, and what trust infrastructure looks like.
- Wrote Chapter 2: "The PAC Framework" — deep walkthrough of all three pillars (Potential, Accountability, Control) with their dimensions, scales, and interdependencies.
- Expanded the Introduction with book purpose, audience, and structure.
- Populated Gaps & Directions with observations and a prioritized list of next chapters.

**Why these first:**
The book was empty. It needed a foundation: a clear problem statement and a thorough explanation of the framework that organizes everything else. These two chapters set up every subsequent chapter.

**Sources used:**
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai (read fresh)
- All of Shane's blog posts (read and analyzed for voice, themes, and claims)
- NIST concept paper on AI agent identity and authorization (February 2026)
- EU AI Act enforcement timeline (August 2026 high-risk obligations)
- Web search on OAuth extensions for agentic AI, agent gateways, DPoP, Zero Trust for agents

**What I noticed:**
- NIST and EU AI Act enforcement are converging on agent governance simultaneously. This timing is significant for the regulatory chapter.
- Agent gateways are an emerging infrastructure pattern that Shane hasn't covered directly but maps well to the Control pillar.
- The complacency problem (better reliability leading to worse oversight) connects to decades of human factors research in aviation. Worth grounding in that literature.
- Shane's framing of "delegation becomes abdication" is the single most important insight for the accountability argument. Built Chapter 1 around it.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Agent Identity and Delegation chapter (strongest source material, high impact)
2. Context Infrastructure chapter (most original contribution from Shane)

## 2026-03-12: Agent Identity and Delegation Chapter

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 3: "Agent Identity and Delegation" covering the full technical landscape of agent identity infrastructure. Sections: trust inversion, why traditional IAM breaks down (history from LDAP through DIDs), OAuth extensions for agents (OBO, DPoP, Auth0 Token Vault), decentralized identity (DIDs, VCs, TSP), Verifiable Intent (Mastercard/Google three-layer SD-JWT), regulatory convergence (NIST, OpenID, eIDAS 2.0), mapping back to PAC infrastructure levels, and practical recommendations.
- Updated Gaps & Directions with new observations on Verifiable Intent and standards convergence.
- Marked Agent Identity as done in the chapter priority list.

**Why this chapter:**
It was the #1 priority in the gaps doc, Shane has the strongest source material across 6+ blog posts, and the standards landscape is moving fast (NIST comment period closes April 2, 2026). Timely and foundational.

**Sources used:**
- Shane's blog posts: trust inversion, IAM breakdown, auth crash course, Google Workspace/OAuth critique, verifiable credentials signing, Verifiable Intent analysis, IAM emerging patterns
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai
- IETF: RFC 8693 (Token Exchange), RFC 9449 (DPoP), draft-oauth-ai-agents-on-behalf-of-user-02
- NIST: "Accelerating the Adoption of Software and AI Agent Identity and Authorization" (Feb 2026)
- OpenID Foundation: AIIM Community Group whitepaper
- Mastercard/Google: Verifiable Intent specification (March 2026)
- Auth0: Token Vault for AI Agents documentation
- Web searches on TSP, eIDAS 2.0, agent identity standards 2026

**What I noticed:**
- Verifiable Intent is the first production-grade answer to Shane's consent theater critique. The three-layer SD-JWT architecture maps cleanly to PAC: Layer 1 is identity (Control), Layer 2 is intent constraints (Accountability), Layer 3 is action proof (all three pillars).
- The identity standards landscape is converging faster than expected. NIST, OpenID, IETF, and industry (Mastercard/Google/Stripe) are all moving simultaneously. The PAC Framework's emphasis on building on standards rather than proprietary solutions is well-timed.
- Auth0 Token Vault is pragmatic but limited: it solves credential management but not purpose encoding or delegation tracking. Good for I2-I3 infrastructure levels.
- The infrastructure maturity table (I1-I5 mapped to identity capabilities) is a useful framing that could extend to other chapters.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Context Infrastructure chapter (Shane's most original contribution, high impact)
2. Regulatory Landscape chapter (timely given August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement)

## 2026-03-12: Context Infrastructure Chapter

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 4: "Context Infrastructure" covering the durable investment thesis for context. Sections: the depreciation cycle (fine-tuning, RAG, scaffolding), the scaffolding trap with Claude Code and Manus examples, what context means (curated information + governed access), context in practice (Claude Code's CLAUDE.md pattern, Manus's KV-cache optimization, Clawdbot as cautionary tale), five dimensions (structure, permissions, discovery, authority, freshness), MCP and A2A as discovery protocols, agent gateways as enforcement layer, the compounding effect, PAC mapping table, infrastructure maturity for context, and practical recommendations.
- Updated SUMMARY.md with new chapter.
- Marked Context Infrastructure as done in gaps.md.

**Why this chapter:**
It was the #1 priority in the gaps doc after identity. Shane's context infrastructure post is one of his most original contributions: the argument that context appreciates while everything else depreciates is counterintuitive and supported by concrete examples. The industry conversation around context engineering has exploded in 2026 (Anthropic's blog post, Manus's lessons, LangChain's framework), providing rich supplementary material.

**Sources used:**
- Shane's blog posts: context infrastructure investment, scaffolding trap/reliability shifting, fitting agentic AI components in a mental model
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai
- Anthropic Engineering Blog: "Effective context engineering for AI agents" (Sep 2025)
- Manus: "Context Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons from Building Manus" (2026)
- LangChain Blog: "Context Engineering for Agents" (2026)
- MCP 2026 roadmap from blog.modelcontextprotocol.io
- Google Cloud Blog: A2A protocol updates (v0.3, 150+ organizations)
- Towards Data Science: "Is RAG Dead? The Rise of Context Engineering and Semantic Layers"
- Multiple industry analyses on agent gateways (Gartner, Solo.io, Composio)
- PIC Protocol specification

**What I noticed:**
- The context engineering conversation has shifted from "how to stuff the prompt" to "how to build organizational information infrastructure." Shane was ahead of this curve: his February 2026 post framed it as infrastructure investment before the industry adopted the terminology.
- Manus's KV-cache insight is operationally important: 100:1 input-to-output ratio means context management is the dominant cost and performance driver, not generation. This validates Shane's emphasis on the information layer over the model layer.
- MCP adoption is striking: 97 million monthly SDK downloads, Linux Foundation governance, adoption by OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. This is becoming the standard discovery protocol for agent context. The 2026 roadmap addresses the right gaps (stateless transport, `.well-known` discovery).
- A2A reaching 150+ organizations with v0.3 and gRPC support signals that agent-to-agent communication is standardizing faster than expected. Auth0 partnering on A2A authentication is a convergence point with the identity chapter.
- Agent gateways are emerging as the "missing layer" analogous to API gateways for microservices. Gartner predicting majority of API gateway vendors will add MCP capabilities by 2026 suggests this will be standard infrastructure.
- The Clawdbot example works on two levels: as evidence that context is powerful (rich context made it compelling) and as evidence that context without control is dangerous (missing access controls made it a risk). This duality maps directly to PAC's Potential-Control interdependence.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Regulatory Landscape chapter (timely given August 2026 EU AI Act enforcement and April 2 NIST comment deadline)
2. Reliability, Evaluation, and the Complacency Trap chapter (human factors angle underexplored)

## 2026-03-12: The Regulatory Landscape Chapter

**What I did:**
- Wrote Chapter 5: "The Regulatory Landscape" covering the full regulatory and standards picture for agent governance. Sections: EU AI Act (risk tiers, the classification problem for agents, provider/distributor/deployer roles, shadow agents and Article 4, high-risk requirements mapped to infrastructure, Commission guidelines), NIST (concept paper on agent identity/authorization, AI Agent Standards Initiative with three pillars), ISO 42001 (management system baseline, certification adoption), U.S. state legislation (Colorado AI Act), standards convergence (IETF agent auth draft, OpenID AIIM, OIDC-A proposal, industry standards), PAC mapping to regulation across all three pillars, infrastructure maturity readiness table (I1-I5 against regulatory requirements), convergence timeline, and practical recommendations.
- Updated SUMMARY.md with new chapter.
- Marked Regulatory Landscape as done in gaps.md.

**Why this chapter:**
It was the #3 priority in the gaps doc and the next logical chapter after identity and context infrastructure. The timing is urgent: EU AI Act high-risk obligations take effect August 2, 2026 (less than 5 months away), NIST comment period closes April 2 (3 weeks away), and the Colorado AI Act goes live June 1. Shane's EU AI Act post is the primary source, supplemented by his boardroom questions post and the LFDT meetup post.

**Sources used:**
- Shane's blog posts: EU AI Act analysis, boardroom questions, LFDT meetup (TSP + PIC), trust inversion, scaffolding trap
- PAC Framework from trustedagentic.ai
- EU AI Act: Articles 4, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 51; Annex III; GPAI Provider Guidelines (July 2025)
- The Future Society: "Ahead of the Curve: Governing AI Agents Under the EU AI Act"
- NIST: NCCoE concept paper (Feb 2026), CAISI AI Agent Standards Initiative (Feb 2026)
- ISO/IEC 42001:2023 documentation and BSI certification information
- IETF: draft-klrc-aiagent-auth-00
- OpenID Foundation: AIIM Community Group, response to NIST RFI
- OIDC-A 1.0 proposal
- Colorado AI Act
- Web searches: EU AI Act 2026 enforcement, NIST agent standards, ISO 42001 adoption, AI agent liability/accountability regulation

**What I noticed:**
- The regulatory convergence is tighter than I expected. EU AI Act (August 2026), Colorado AI Act (June 2026), and NIST standards work (Q1-Q2 2026) all land in the same window. Organizations that build infrastructure now get compliance as a byproduct. Organizations that wait will face simultaneous deadlines.
- NIST's framing of the AI Agent Standards Initiative uses a Potential argument: fragmented ecosystems stunt adoption. This is interesting because it aligns NIST with PAC's value-first approach rather than purely security or compliance framing.
- ISO 42001 fills a specific gap: it provides the management system scaffolding within which technical solutions operate. It does not solve agent identity or authorization, but it formalizes the governance loops that make technical solutions accountable.
- The infrastructure maturity table (I1-I5 mapped to regulatory readiness) turned out to be a useful synthesis. Most organizations are at I1-I2 for agent deployments. Regulatory timelines demand I3+ for high-risk uses by August 2026. That is a significant infrastructure gap to close in 5 months.
- Shane's LFDT meetup post (March 11, 2026) introduces PIC (Provenance, Identity, Continuity) as a complementary approach to TSP. The PIC paradigm shift from "proof of possession" to "proof of continuity" is relevant to the regulatory discussion because it eliminates the confused deputy problem mathematically rather than mitigating it through policy. This deserves deeper treatment in a future chapter.

**Next session priorities:**
1. Reliability, Evaluation, and the Complacency Trap chapter (human factors angle, strongest remaining gap)
2. Agent Payments and Economics chapter (x402, payment as trust signal)
